Full	specification	for	input.txt:
<ALGO>
<START STATE>
<GOAL STATE>
<NUMBER OF LIVE TRAFFIC LINES>
<… LIVE TRAFFIC LINES …>
<NUMBER OF SUNDAY TRAFFIC LINES>
<… SUNDAY TRAFFIC LINES …>
where:
<ALGO>	is	the	algorithm	to	use	and	will	be	one of:	“BFS”,	“DFS”,	“UCS”,	“A*”.
<START	STATE>	is	a	string	with	the	name	of	the	start	location	(e.g.,	JordanHome).
<GOAL	STATE>	is	a	string	with	the	name	of	the	goal	location	(e.g.,	StaplesCenter).
<NUMBER	OF	LIVE	TRAFFIC	LINES>	is	the	number	of	lines	of live	traffic	information	that	follow.
<…	LIVE	TRAFFIC	LINES	…>	are	lines	of	live	traffic	information	in	the	format	described	above,	
i.e.,	<STATE1>	<STATE2>	<TRAVEL	TIME	FROM	STATE1	TO	STATE2>
<NUMBER	OF	SUNDAY	TRAFFIC	LINES>	is	the	number	of	lines	of	Sunday	traffic	estimates	that	
follow.
<…	SUNDAY	TRAFFIC	LINES	…>	are	lines	of	sunday	traffic	information	in	the	format	described	
above,	i.e.,	<STATE>	<ESTIMATED	TIME	FROM	STATE	TO	GOAL>
Full	specification	for	output.txt:
Any	number	of	lines	with	the	following	format	for	each:
<STATE> <ACCUMULATED TRAVEL TIME FROM START TO HERE>
